/* Regression test against bug in TBB allocator, manifested when 
   dynamic library calls atexit or register dtors of static objects.
   If the allocator is not initialized yet, we can got deadlock, 
   because allocator library has static object dtors as well, they
   registred during allocator initialization, and atexit is protected 
   by non-recursive mutex in some GLIBCs.
